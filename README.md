# 🧠 AI Usage Report: ADmyBRAND Landing Page

This project was developed using a suite of AI tools to speed up development, enhance UI quality, and support code generation.

## Tools Used
- **Cursor AI:** Accelerated initial layout scaffolding, component stubs, and project structure.
- **GitHub Copilot:** Used heavily for Tailwind utility classes, Framer Motion integration, form validation logic, and animations.
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4o):** Helped architect the component system, define design patterns (glassmorphism + futuristic), and generate UI/UX copy.
- **Midjourney (for visuals):** Generated hero background and visual assets with prompts like “glass futuristic dashboard in deep space with glow particles”.

## Prompts Used
- “Create a stunning glassmorphic hero section for a modern AI SaaS landing page in Next.js.”
- “Generate a pricing section with animated cards using Tailwind and Framer Motion.”
- “Add scroll-based animation to each section on the page using Framer Motion.”

## Impact
Using AI helped reduce development time by 40–50% while improving overall visual quality and consistency. AI also supported experimentation with visual aesthetics (e.g., blur depths, color variants, and motion curves).
